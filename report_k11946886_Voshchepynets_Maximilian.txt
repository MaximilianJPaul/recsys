Approach: Item-based Collaborative Filtering for Music Recommendation

Introduction
The challenge given was to recommend songs to users of Last FM, with a primary goal of maximizing overall nDCG. The dataset, LFM2b, was utilized for the task. The adopted recommendation approach was item-based collaborative filtering, a method often preferred for its simplicity and interpretability.

Implementation Details
Item-based collaborative filtering is a type of recommendation approach that bases its suggestions on the similarity between items. It essentially recommends items that are similar to those that a user has rated or interacted with in the past.
For this challenge, the similarity between items (songs) was calculated based on the co-listening patterns of the users. The assumption here is that if two songs are often listened to by the same users, they are likely to be similar. To find the similarity between two items, the cosine similarity metric was used.
After calculating the similarity between songs, recommendations were generated for each user by identifying the songs most similar to the ones the user has listened to before.

Hyperparameter tuning
The hyperparameter parameter nearest neighbor was optimized by calculating the nDCG score on test dataset. By implementing the exhaustive search, the value 5 was found to be the most promising.

Evaluation
The performance of the recommender system was evaluated on the provided test interaction dataset using the nDCG metric. The obtained results were promising and showcased a significant improvement over the baseline POP recommender. 

Conclusion
Overall, the item-based collaborative filtering approach provided a successful recommendation system for the Last FM dataset. It allowed the system to provide personalized song recommendations for the users based on their listening habits. Future work may include exploring more complex models like matrix factorization or neural collaborative filtering for further improvements.
